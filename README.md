IBM Watson Workspace Connections Expert Finder
==============================================

When adding this app to a space, it will listen to the conversation and detect when someone needs an expert on a topic. Think about phrases like this :

- I really need an sme on dx

- Who knows about social strategy ?

- I need a Connections expert in Belgium

- ...

When detected, the bot will take the keywords and use those to do a tag search in Connections Profiles and return the results to the space.
